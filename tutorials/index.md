## How StackCrafted tutorials are structured

Each tutorial consists of two parts:

### 1) Website Guide (this repository)

Located in the **stackcrafted-org** repository.  
These pages provide the full written walkthrough.

### 2) Configuration Repository

Each tutorial has its own GitHub repo containing:

- docker-compose.yml  
- config files  
- README.md with quick-start instructions  

The website guide always links to the matching repo.
